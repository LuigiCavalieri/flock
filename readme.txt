== Description ==

A modern yet classic theme featured by minimalism and designed to put emphasis on what matter the most, your flock of thoughts.

Flock can help you create a personal blog equipped with easily customisable menus, featured images, sticky posts, footer widgets, a threaded comments section,  and a few other needful functionalities like an always-at-hand search form. The degree of customizability is still limited in this first iteration, nonetheless through the Theme Customize Screen you can already let your personality colour Flock.

With or without a logo, Flock will allow you to give to your personal blog, identity, and a clean look.


== Installation ==

1. Go to `Appearance > Themes` and click on 'Add New'.
2. Search for 'Flock' using the search form.
3. Click on 'Activate'.
4. Navigate to `Appearance > Customize` to give Flock a personal touch.


== Changelog ==

= 1.0.7 (16 November 2021) =

* Fixed some layout inconsistencies that emerged when the footer included one or more widgets.
* Fixed some bugs in the global JS script and upgraded the code to JS6.

= 1.0.6 (9 October 2021) =

Added the Theme URI and updated the screenshot.

= 1.0.5 (2 September 2021) =

Now Flock enqueues the main stylesheet by using `get_template_directory_uri()` in place of `get_stylesheet_uri()`. This simplifies the way how child themes have to enqueue their `style.css` file.

= 1.0.4 (25 August 2021) =

Fixed: no primary menu showed up in the previewer.

= 1.0.3 (25 August 2021) =

Fixed: the theme's description didn't show up in its unabridged version on WordPress.org.

= 1.0.2 (20 August 2021) =

* Added a "Skip to content" link â€” visible only to screen readers or when navigating by keyboard (TAB key).
* Moved the global script to a standalone file.
* Updated front-facing credits to comply with WordPress.org requirements.

= 1.0.1 (16 August 2021) =

Fixed: two errors in the generated markup prevented some pages from being validated as HTML5 documents.

= 1.0 (14 August 2021) =

Flock is born.
